    <div id="main">
        <div> RAM (random access memory) is the place in a computing device where the operating system (OS), application programs
            and data in current use are kept so they can be quickly reached by the device's processor. RAM is much faster
            to read from and write to than other kinds of storage in a computer, such as a hard disk drive (HDD), solid-state
            drive (SSD) or optical drive. Data remains in RAM as long as the computer is running. When the computer is turned
            off, RAM loses its data. When the computer is turned on again, the OS and other files are once again loaded into
            RAM, usually from an HDD or SSD.</div>

        <div>ROM is "built-in" computer memory containing data that normally can only be read, not written to. ROM contains the
            programming that allows your computer to be "booted up" or regenerated each time you turn it on. Unlike a computer's
            random access memory (RAM), the data in ROM is not lost when the computer power is turned off. The ROM is sustained
            by a small long-life battery in your computer. If you ever do the hardware setup procedure with your computer,
            you effectively will be writing to ROM.

        </div>
        <div>Dynamic random access memory (DRAM) is a type of memory that is typically used for data or program code that a computer
            processor needs to function. DRAM is a common type of random access memory (RAM) used in personal computers (PCs),
            workstations and servers. Random access allows the PC processor to access any part of the memory directly rather
            than having to proceed sequentially from a starting place. RAM is located close to a computer’s processor and
            enables faster access to data than storage media such as hard disk drives and solid-state drives.
        </div>
        <div>Stands for "Static Random Access Memory." I know it is tempting to pronounce this term as "Sram," but it is correctly
            pronounced "S-ram." SRAM is a type of RAM that stores data using a static method, in which the data remains constant
            as long as electric power is supplied to the memory chip. This is different than DRAM (dynamic RAM), which stores
            data dynamically and constantly needs to refresh the data stored in the memory. Because SRAM stores data statically,
            it is faster and requires less power than DRAM.
