        <div>JPG is a file extension for a lossy graphics file. The JPEG file extension is used interchangeably with JPG. JPEG
            stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group who created the standard. JPG files have 2 sub-formats, JPG/Exif
            (often used in digital cameras and photographic equipment), and JPG/JFIF (often used on the World Wide Web).

        </div>
        <div>PNG (pronounced ping as in ping-pong; for Portable Network Graphics) is a file format for image compression that,
            in time, is expected to replace the Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) that is widely used on today's Internet.
            Owned by Unisys, the GIF format and its usage in image-handling software involves licensing or other legal considerations.
            (Web users can make, view, and send GIF files freely but they can't develop software that builds them without
            an arrangement with Unisys.) The PNG format, on the other hand, was developed by an Internet committee expressly
            to be patent-free. It provides a number of improvements over the GIF format.

        </div>
        <div>It is understandable that computer users who encounter this acronym for the first time might well assume that since
            the “G” stands for “graphic,” gif should similarly be pronounced with an initial hard g, as in go and give.
        </div>
        <div>Short for "Bitmap." It can be pronounced as "bump," "B-M-P," or simply a "bitmap image." The BMP format is a commonly
            used raster graphic format for saving image files. It was introduced on the Windows platform, but is now recognized
            by many programs on both Macs and PCs.
        </div>
        <div>Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is the description of an image as an application of the Extensible Markup Language
            (XML). Any program such as a Web browser that recognizes XML can display the image using the information provided
            in the SVG format. Different from a raster graphicsscalable part of the term emphasizes that vector graphic images
            can easily be made scalable (whereas an image specified in raster graphics is a fixed-size bitmap). Thus, the
            SVG format enables the viewing of an image on a computer display of any size and resolution, whether a tiny LCD
            screen in a cell phone or a large CRT display in a workstation. In addition to ease of size reduction and enlargement,
            SVG allows text within images to be recognized as such, so that the text can be located by a search engine and
            easily translated into other languages.
