        <div>The hard drive is what stores all your data. It houses the hard disk, where all your files and folders are physically
            located. A typical hard drive is only slightly larger than your hand, yet can hold over 100 GB of data. The data
            is stored on a stack of disks that are mounted inside a solid encasement. These disks spin extremely fast (typically
            at either 5400 or 7200 RPM) so that data can be accessed immediately from anywhere on the drive. The data is
            stored on the hard drive magnetically, so it stays on the drive even after the power supply is turned off.
        </div>
        <div>A solid-state drive (SSD) is a nonvolatile storage device that stores persistent data on solid-state flash memory.
            Solid-state drives actually aren't hard drives in the traditional sense of the term, as there are no moving parts
            involved. A traditional hard disk drive (HDD) consists of a spinning disk with a read/write head on a mechanical
            arm called an actuator. An SSD, on the other hand, has an array of semiconductor memory organized as a disk drive,
            using integrated circuits (ICs) rather than magnetic or optical storage media. An SSD may also be referred to
            as a solid-state disk.
        </div>
        <div>CD-ROM (Compact Disc, read-only-memory) is an adaptation of the CD that is designed to store computer data in the
            form of text and graphics, as well as hi-fi stereo sound. The original data format standard was defined by Philips
            and Sony in the 1983 Yellow Book. Other standards are used in conjunction with it to define directory and file
            structures, including ISO 9660, HFS (Hierarchal File System, for Macintosh computers), and Hybrid HFS-ISO. Format
            of the CD-ROM is the same as for audio CDs: a standard CD is 120 mm (4.75 inches) in diameter and 1.2 mm (0.05
            inches) thick and is composed of a polycarbonate plastic substrate (underlayer - this is the main body of the
            disc), one or more thin reflective metal (usually aluminum) layers, and a lacquer coating.
        </div>
        <div>Blu-ray is an optical disc format designed to display high definition video and store large amounts of data. Blu-ray
            is the successor to DVD. The standard was developed collaboratively by Hitachi, LG, Matsushita (Panasonic), Pioneer,
            Philips, Samsung, Sharp, Sony, and Thomson. It became the default optical disk standard for HD content and optical
            data storage after winning a format war with HD-DVD, the format promoted by Toshiba and NEC.
