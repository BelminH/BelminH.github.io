    <div id="main">
        <div> RAM (random access memory) is the place in a computing device where the operating system (OS), application programs
            and data in current use are kept so they can be quickly reached by the device's processor. RAM is much faster
            to read from and write to than other kinds of storage in a computer, such as a hard disk drive (HDD), solid-state
            drive (SSD) or optical drive. Data remains in RAM as long as the computer is running. When the computer is turned
            off, RAM loses its data. When the computer is turned on again, the OS and other files are once again loaded into
            RAM, usually from an HDD or SSD.</div>
